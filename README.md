<h1 align="center"> PRECISION DRUG RECOMMENDATION EMPOWERED
BY FINE-GRAINED EXPLORATION OF MOTIF RELATIONSHIPS </h1>

## About Our Work

Update: 2023/11/29: We have created a repository for the paper titled *via In-depth Exploration of Motif Relationships*, which has been submitted to the *IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)*. In this repository, we offer the original sample datasets, preprocessing scripts, and algorithm files to showcase the reproducibility of our work.

```

In accordance with the requirements of the **PhysioNet Clinical Databases**, we are unable to openly share the data without prior permission. Researchers interested in accessing the data can submit their requests through the following website, and a concise application process can be found here: [MIMIC-III](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) and [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/).

## RUN

```powershell
# unzip all files into the data directory
cd /root/DrugRec/data
python preprocess.py # preprocess
cd /root/DrugRec/src
python main.py # main file
```

## Contact

We will update the contact information and corresponding issue links after the review process is completed.
